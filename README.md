# 👨‍💻 About Me

17 years old Computer science student from Hungary 🇭🇺

I focus on building real, usable software — not toy demos.

My interests are backend development, web technologies, and systems-level thinking,
with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, logic, and long-term maintainability.

I’ve already delivered a real client project for **Future Green Technology**,
covering requirements handling, deployment, and production-like constraints:
